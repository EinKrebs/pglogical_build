Description: Logical Replication Extension for PostgreSQL
 The pglogical extension provides logical streaming replication between
 PostgreSQL instances, using a publish/subscribe model.  Contrary to the
 built-in streaming replication, pglogical can replicate between major versions
 or different architectures and is not restricted to replicate the entire
 instance but can selectively replicate arbitrary sets of tables.
 .
 Use-Cases include migrations and major-version upgrades, aggregation of
 several databases into a Data Warehouse, It utilises the Logical Decoding
 features available since PostgreSQL 9.4 working with low overhead on both
 provider and subscriber.
